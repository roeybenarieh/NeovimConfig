# Installation
there are a few packets you need to install so everything would work: <br />
sudo apt install npm <br />
sudo apt install nerd-fonts

a few packets needed to be installed threw Mason (the nvim packet manager used by nvchad) <br />
:MasonInstallAll  # for installing all of the packages in the my custom configurations <br />
:TSInstall python # for installing the python language for the tree sitter (this is something that helps neovim better understand our code)

##  TODO:
easy way to copy text to clipboard <br />
better static type checker, unused variables doesnt show warning<br />
use these plugins:
- gaborvecsei/memento.nvim # for keeping track of deleted buffers
- nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim # for better neovim statusline
- phaazon/hop.nvim # for jumping around the document faster
- goolord/alpha-nvim # greater for neovim
- maybe also AckslD/nvim-neoclip.lua # for keeping track of yanked/saved content (like windows Ctrl-c history)

Install things localy
